# Dog Breed Model

*A CNN for predicting dog breeds from images.*

This repository follows a 
[post](https://www.douglasdaly.com/blog/dog-breed-identifier) on my 
[blog](https://www.douglasdaly.com/blog).


## Getting Started

First clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/douglasdaly/dog-breed-model.git
```

Then create the virtual environment for the project (including creating
a new IPyKernel):

```bash
$ make setup
```

Get the data:

```bash
$ make data
```

Then you're good to go!  Have a look at the Jupyter notebooks in the
`notebooks/` directory.
